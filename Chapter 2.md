### Caucus v. Primary?

Every four years, American states hold either a primary election or caucuses, part of which is to choose that state's top Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. So what's the difference between the two? Caucuses are elections run by political parties, while primaries are run by state governments. In an open primary, registered voters select whichever candidate they want regardless of party affiliation; in a closed primary, voters must be registered with a political party and they can only select a candidate within their selected party. But caucuses are different. In some caucuses, secret ballots are cast, while in others, people openly show support for their favorite candidate. Caucus-goers gather to debate issues and share concerns. Caucus-goers in Iowa's Democratic caucus gather in groups to support their chosen candidate. If after the first round of grouping, a candidate doesn't have 15% support, they are deemed nonviable, and supporters in their group must either join another candidate's group or convince caucus-goers in other groups to join theirs until 15% is reached. In the 2020 election cycle, primaries and caucuses will run through the early summer, but a party's nominee is usually apparent well before the caucuses and elections are completed. However, across the US, Democrats and Republicans won't officially nominate their candidate until the party's national conventions next summer.
