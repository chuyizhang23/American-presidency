# The Road to the White House

## Primary Politics

### Caucus v. Primary?

The Constitution, state law, political party rules, and traditions shape the road to the White House.

> The text in the Constitution concerning presidential elections primarily appears in Article II, Sections 1, 2, and 3.
>
> - Article II, Section 1 outlines the process of electing the President and Vice President through the Electoral College.
> - Article II, Section 2 describes the powers and responsibilities of the President, including serving as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and granting pardons.
> - Article II, Section 3 details the duties of the President, such as delivering the State of the Union address and ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.
>
> Additionally, the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1804, modified the process for electing the President and Vice President by establishing separate Electoral College votes for each office.

In order to join the race for the presidency, candidates must first be nominated through caucuses and primaries. These candidates use the caucuses and primaries to test the waters and see if they stand a chance of becoming a candidate, assessing whether their candidacy is sufficient to raise money. Many of the initial candidates actually decide to drop out of the contest during the first phase of the election, with caucuses and primaries narrowing the field of candidates to one.

States are in charge of organizing primaries, and over time there have been two ways to what we refer to in a general way as “primaries”. We are currently in the primary phase. What is the difference between caucus and primary?

Every four years, American states hold either a primary election or caucuses, part of which is to choose that state's top Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. So what's the difference between the two? Caucuses are elections run by political parties, while primaries are run by state governments. In an open primary, registered voters select whichever candidate they want regardless of party affiliation; in a closed primary, voters must be registered with a political party and they can only select a candidate within their selected party. But caucuses are different. In some caucuses, secret ballots are cast, while in others, people openly show support for their favorite candidate. Caucus-goers gather to debate issues and share concerns. Caucus-goers in Iowa's Democratic caucus gather in groups to support their chosen candidate. If after the first round of grouping, a candidate doesn't have 15% support, they are deemed nonviable, and supporters in their group must either join another candidate's group or convince caucus-goers in other groups to join theirs until 15% is reached. In the 2020 election cycle, primaries and caucuses will run through the early summer, but a party's nominee is usually apparent well before the caucuses and elections are completed. However, across the US, Democrats and Republicans won't officially nominate their candidate until the party's national conventions next summer.

>      - Idaho: Holds closed primaries for presidential elections but caucuses for state elections.
>
> 2. **What is an open primary, closed primary, and semi-open primary?**
>
>    An open primary is a type of primary election in which voters are not required to declare their party affiliation and can choose to vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. In a closed primary, only voters who are registered members of a particular political party can participate and vote for candidates from that party. A semi-open primary is a hybrid of the two, where voters can choose to vote in either party's primary, but they may be required to publicly declare their party affiliation at the polling place.
>
> 3. **For states that have primaries only, do voters directly vote for their preferred presidential candidate, or do they vote for delegates?**
>
>    In states that have primaries only, voters directly vote for their preferred presidential candidate. The results of the primary determine the allocation of delegates to each candidate based on their share of the vote. These delegates then represent their candidate at the national party convention, where the party's nominee is officially chosen.
>
> 4. **For states that have primaries only, how are the exact delegates chosen?**
>
>    In states that have primaries only, the exact delegates are typically chosen through a process determined by each political party's rules. These rules often specify how delegates are allocated based on the results of the primary election. For example, delegates may be allocated proportionally to the candidates based on their share of the vote, or winner-takes-all in some cases. The specific method varies by state and party.
>
> 5. **What are the states where the winner takes all in the primary?**
>
>    States that operate under a "winner-takes-all" system in their primary elections include:
>
>    Florida, Ohio, Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey, Delaware, Missouri, District of Columbia, Montana (Republican)
>
>    Please note that these states may have variations in their winner-takes-all rules, such as awarding all delegates to the candidate who wins the statewide popular vote, or awarding delegates on a winner-takes-all basis within specific congressional districts.
>
> 6. **Is it state law or party rules that determine how delegates are allocated based on primary elections?**
>
>    Party rules typically determine how delegates are allocated based on primary elections. Each political party establishes its own rules for delegate allocation, which may vary from state to state. These rules govern factors such as whether delegates are allocated proportionally or on a winner-takes-all basis, the thresholds candidates must meet to receive delegates, and how uncommitted delegates are allocated. While state laws may have some influence, party rules generally have a more significant impact on delegate allocation.
>
> 7. **For states that have caucuses, how does it work?**
>
>    In states that have caucuses, the process typically involves voters gathering at local meetings to discuss and vote on their preferred presidential candidate. Caucus attendees may publicly express their support for a candidate, engage in debates, and participate in multiple rounds of voting if necessary. The results of the caucus determine the allocation of delegates to each candidate based on their level of support among caucus attendees. These delegates then represent their candidate at the party's county, district, and state conventions, ultimately leading to the selection of delegates to attend the national convention.
>
> 8. **Are primaries held at the state level or at the county and district level? What about caucuses?**
>
>    Primaries are typically held at the state level, where voters across the state participate in selecting their preferred presidential candidate. However, some states may also have primary elections at the county or district level for other political offices.
>
>    Caucuses, on the other hand, are usually held at the precinct or local level within a state. Voters gather in person at designated locations, such as schools or community centers, to participate in the caucus process and express their preferences for presidential candidates.
>
> 9. **In caucuses, do voters choose the presidential candidates or choose their delegates?**
>
>    In caucuses, voters typically participate in selecting both the presidential candidates and choosing delegates to represent them at subsequent party conventions. During the caucus process, voters express their preferences for presidential candidates, and the results determine the allocation of delegates to each candidate. These delegates then represent their candidate at county, district, and state conventions, ultimately leading to the selection of delegates to attend the national convention.
>
> 10. **If I want to be a delegate, what do I need to do?**
>
>     If you want to be a delegate, you typically need to get involved in the political party's process for selecting delegates. This often involves participating in local party meetings, precinct caucuses, or primary elections, where delegates are elected or selected to represent their area at higher levels of the party organization. You may need to express your interest in becoming a delegate and garner support from fellow party members to increase your chances of being selected. Additionally, understanding the rules and procedures set by the party for delegate selection can be crucial in navigating the process effectively.
>
> 11. **In a county or district, is there only one caucus meeting or multiple?**
>
>     In a county or district, there may be multiple caucus meetings held at different locations within the area. These meetings allow more voters to participate and ensure broader representation in the caucus process. The specific number of caucus meetings can vary depending on factors such as population size, geographic distribution, and party organization preferences.
>
> 12. **Who is eligible to attend a caucus meeting?**
>
>     Eligibility to attend a caucus meeting varies depending on the rules set by the political party and the state. Generally, individuals who are registered voters and affiliated with the party hosting the caucus are eligible to participate. However, some states allow same-day registration or participation regardless of party affiliation. It's essential to check the specific requirements set by the party and state to determine eligibility for attending a caucus meeting.
>
> 13. **How can one ensure that a voter does not attend caucus meetings multiple times at different locations? How can one ensure that individuals affiliated with another party do not participate in the caucus meeting?**
>
>     To prevent a voter from attending caucus meetings multiple times at different locations, caucus organizers typically maintain voter registration lists or check-in procedures to verify each attendee's eligibility and participation status. This helps ensure that individuals cannot attend multiple caucus meetings simultaneously.
>
>     To prevent individuals affiliated with another party from participating in the caucus meeting, caucus organizers may require attendees to provide proof of party affiliation or voter registration with the hosting party. Additionally, some states have closed caucuses, where only registered members of the party can participate, further ensuring that individuals from other parties do not attend. Organizers may also implement check-in procedures to verify party affiliation before allowing participation in the caucus.
>
> 14. **What is a closed caucus and what is an open caucus?**
>
>     A closed caucus is a type of caucus where only registered members of the political party hosting the caucus are allowed to participate. Participants must be affiliated with the party to attend and vote in the caucus proceedings.
>
>     An open caucus, on the other hand, is a type of caucus where eligible voters, regardless of party affiliation, are allowed to participate. In open caucuses, individuals may attend and vote in the caucus proceedings without being required to be registered members of the hosting party.
>
> 15. **If I want to be a member of the Democratic Party , what should I do?**
>
>     To become a member of the Democratic Party, you typically need to register as a Democrat with your state's election office or board of elections. The process for registering may vary depending on your state's laws and regulations. In some states, you can register online, while in others, you may need to submit a paper registration form by mail or in person. You can usually find registration information and forms on your state's election website or by contacting your local election office.
>
> 16. **Who makes speeches for the presidential candidates during caucus meetings?**
>
>     During caucus meetings, supporters or representatives of presidential candidates typically make speeches advocating for their preferred candidate. These speeches aim to persuade undecided caucus participants and gather support for their candidate. The speakers may highlight the candidate's qualifications, policy positions, and accomplishments to sway caucus-goers. Additionally, candidates themselves may attend caucus meetings to deliver speeches and engage directly with voters.
>
> 17. **For states with a combination of primaries and caucuses, how does it work?**
>
>     In states with a combination of primaries and caucuses, the process can vary depending on the specific rules established by the political party and the state. Generally, some areas within the state may hold primary elections, where voters cast their ballots in a manner similar to general elections. In other areas, caucus meetings may be held, where voters gather to discuss and vote on their preferred presidential candidate.
>
>     The combination approach allows for flexibility in the nomination process and may reflect the preferences of different regions within the state. It can also provide opportunities for broader participation and engagement among party members. The specific details of how primaries and caucuses are conducted in these states are determined by party rules, state laws, and party organization preferences.
>
> 18. **For states that use a combination of primaries and conventions, how does it work? How does it differ from a general primary?**
>
>     In states that use a combination of primaries and conventions, the process typically involves both a primary election and a subsequent convention where delegates are selected.
>
>     During the primary election, voters cast their ballots to determine the allocation of delegates to each presidential candidate. These delegates are usually bound to support a specific candidate based on the primary results.
>
>     Following the primary, a convention is held where delegates from each candidate's campaign or supporters gather to formally elect delegates to represent them at the national convention. This convention may involve additional rounds of voting or negotiations to determine the final allocation of delegates.
>
>     The key difference from a general primary is the inclusion of a convention component, where delegates are formally selected to represent each candidate at the national level. This process allows for further deliberation and organization within the party before the final selection of delegates to the national convention.
>
> 19. **What's the condition for a candidate to have their name on the primary ballot?**
>
>     To have their name on the primary ballot, a candidate typically needs to meet certain eligibility requirements set by state law. These requirements often include gathering a certain number of signatures from registered voters, paying a filing fee, and submitting necessary paperwork by a specified deadline. Additionally, candidates may need to meet other qualifications such as being a registered member of the party for which they seek nomination.
>
> 20. **During primaries, can voters vote for someone who is not on the ballot?**
>
>     During primaries, voters typically can only choose from the candidates listed on the ballot. Write-in candidates are not usually allowed in primary elections, although this can vary depending on state laws and party rules.

The similarity between caucuses and primaries is that both procedures are indirect. In both, party voters choose delegates to represent them at the national convention, where the official nomination of a candidate takes place. These delegates are given the authority to make the nomination decision on behalf of the voters. While voters may know which candidate a delegate supports, the primary result is ultimately an indirect outcome, as it is the delegates who formally make the nomination decision. This indirect process can sometimes lead to confusion when interpreting the primary results.

Most states use the primary system, which results in 80% of the convention delegates. This system typically receives more media attention due to its widespread use and influence in determining the nomination outcome. However, there are a few states where caucuses are used instead of primaries.

Caucuses are meetings organized by political parties, where participants physically gather in a room and split into groups according to the candidate they support.

Primaries are held at the state level and allow citizens to vote for their candidate anonymously by casting a secret vote. There are differences between the types of primaries. Most primaries are **closed primaries**, meaning that only registered members of a specific party can participate. In states with closed primaries, separate elections are held for Republicans and Democrats. There are also **open primaries**, where voters from any party can participate. Additionally, there is a **third type** where voters from different parties and independents can participate.

> The rules regarding independent voters' participation in primary elections vary depending on the state and the type of primary being held. In some states with open primaries, independent voters are allowed to participate and vote for candidates regardless of party affiliation. However, in states with closed primaries, only registered members of a specific party can participate, so independent voters may not be able to vote unless they affiliate with a party. Semi-open primaries may allow independent voters to participate, but it depends on the specific rules of each state. It's essential to check your state's laws and regulations regarding primary elections to determine if you, as an independent voter, can participate in open, closed, or semi-open primaries.

### The 2020 Democratic Primaries

Regarding the number of candidates, it always decreases during the initial phase, as seen in the 2020 Democratic primaries. At the beginning, there were 25 candidates. When voting began for the first caucuses, only 11 remained in the race, with many exiting before the voting phase. Between the first caucuses and Super Tuesday (the day when many primaries are held), several candidates ended their campaigns, and others dropped out after the results of Super Tuesday. In April, Sanders left the race, leaving Biden as the sole remaining candidate.

Most relevant who participated in the primary debates:

- 2 liberal Democrats:
  - Bernie Sanders (Senator - VT)
  - Elizabeth Warren (Senator – MA)
- 4 moderate Democrats:
  - Joe Biden (Former VP)
  - Michael Bloomberg (former NYC mayor)
  - Pete Buttigieg (Mayor)
  - Amy Klobuchar (Senator)

### 2024 Presidential Election

#### Timeline of the 2024 Presidential Election

- Currently: Democratic and Republican primaries
  - March 5^th^: Super Tuesday, the biggest single day of primaries
- June 4^th^: final state primaries
- July 15-18: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate
- August 19-22: Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the party formally chooses its candidate
- September 16^th^: date set by the Commission on Presidential Debates for the 1st presidential debates (at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas)
- General election: November 5^th^, 2024
- January 6^th^, 2025: Electoral College Vote

#### The Democratic Primary

If we look at the Democratic primary, the three major candidates are Joe Biden, Dean Phillips, and Marianne Williamson. The results of the presidential primary showed 96.2% support for Biden, indicating that the other two candidates had very low chances of remaining in the race for long.

#### The Republican Primary

A situation similar to the 2020 Democratic primaries occurred, where initially, several candidates were in the race but eventually dropped out. The last major candidate to drop out was Roe DeSantis. While some delegates supported other candidates, their numbers were significantly lower compared to the major candidates.

During the primary season, there are televised debates in which various candidates discuss their respective ideas. However, Trump acts separately and does not participate in debates with other candidates.

## The Conventions

The national convention is where party delegates pick their official candidate. There are two separate conventions for each party.

Now that there is no doubt about the result of the conventions (Biden for Democratic and Trump for Republican), the role of the national conventions has changed. It is a place where candidates rally around someone, though what people mostly see is opposition between candidates of the same party.

The conventions served as an opportunity for party members to gather and discuss the party's platform: the ideas the candidate is going to defend in the elections. For a long time, the convention was an important venue for political debate and decision-making.

Now, both conventions are televised events. They are essentially media shows aimed at demonstrating that the internal disagreements of the primary season are over and convincing the public to identify with a nominee. The party conventions offer competing media presentations of their ideas and candidates. The key question during the national convention is which of these appeals will be more successful at convincing the public which candidate is better.

Two types of delegates exist:

- Pledged delegates: The majority of delegates fall into this category. They are required to respect the results of the primary season, including primaries and caucuses.

- Unpledged delegates: The minority of delegates fall into this category. They are not obligated to follow the aforementioned rule.

When a delegate votes, they cast their vote for a presidential ticket, simultaneously voting for the presidential candidate and their vice-presidential running mate.

After the elections, debates are organized between the candidates. This year, the first presidential debate will be on September 16th. Debates are organized by a variety of groups, including universities for the first debates. The campaign ends on November 5th, 2024, the day of the elections. There are also indirect presidential elections in which voters select the members of the electoral college.

> Q&A:
>
> 1. **How many delegates are there in total at the Democratic National Convention? And how many are there in the Republican? How many of the delegates are pledged delegates, and how many are unpledged delegates?**
>
>    - Democrats: In 2024, there are an estimated 4,672 delegates: 3,933 (84%) pledged delegates and 739 (16%) automatic delegates (more commonly known as superdelegates).
>
>    - Republicans: In 2024, there are an estimated 2,429 delegates: 2,325 (96%) pledged delegates and 104 (4%) unpledged delegates.
>
> 2. **Does the number of delegates at the national convention vary with each election?**
>
>    Yes, the number of delegates at the national convention can vary with each election. Factors such as changes in party rules, the results of primaries and caucuses, and adjustments made by the parties themselves can all affect the total number of delegates participating in the convention. Additionally, the inclusion of unpledged delegates, such as superdelegates in the Democratic Party, can also contribute to variations in the total delegate count from one election to another.

>
>      The pledged delegate "base" allocation is determined by the jurisdiction's Presidential vote in 2012, 2016, and 2020; and the jurisdiction's electoral vote allocation based on 2020 census. Jurisdictions beginning their process later in the cycle and neighboring states that concurrently begin their process (aka "clustering") receive bonus delegates.

## The Electoral College

In the US, the popular vote, which counts the number of supporters for candidates, and the Electoral College votes are two separate things. Despite people voting for candidates and not electors directly, networks often display maps of the country that track the number of electoral votes to be assigned, rather than the popular vote.

### Why the Framers created the Electoral College?

“It was [...] desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to so complicated an investigation.” (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist, No. 68)

Instead of a large mass of potentially misinformed voters, there will be a small number of electors.

### How does the Electoral College work?

Election Day when Americans everywhere cast their ballot for the next President of the United States, except not really, Americans don't directly vote for president. It's a bit complicated because of something called the Electoral College, think of the Electoral College as the collection of 538 votes that determine who the President of the United States will be. Why 538? Because that's the number of senators 100 plus a number of representatives 438. And Congress. These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't given to the citizens directly, but are instead divided among the states. Each state no matter how populous or not gets three votes to start, the remaining votes are given out roughly in proportion to the population of the states, the more people the state has, the more votes it gets.

In early November, when citizens go to the polls, they aren't voting for president directly, but they're really telling their state how they want it to use its electoral votes. 48 of the 50 states give all their electoral college votes to the candidate who wins a majority in their state. Take Florida, for example, which has 29 Electoral College votes. If a candidate wins a majority, no matter how small that majority, he gets all the votes. So the path to the White House is clear, when enough majorities and enough states to get more than half of the Electoral College votes and you get to sit at the big desk.

There were a few details left out. The Electoral College love states, but what about the 11 million Americans who don't live in a state? What happens to their vote? And where are these people hiding? There were about 600,000 in the District of Columbia and area set aside specifically not to be a state so that the capital of the country would be free of local politics. For most of the United States history, people living in the district didn't get to vote for president. Then in 1964, the Constitution was amended to give DC the same number of votes as the least populous state, Wyoming. So the Electoral College likes DC, but you know who doesn't like? The territories, the often forgotten Puerto Rico Guam, US Virgin Islands in Northern Mariana Islands get no votes from the Electoral College because they aren't states and they don't have a special constitutional amendment to recognize them. Which is a bit odd considering they're part of the United States and everyone who lives there as a citizen. So for most practical purposes, they're just like DC. 4.4 million people live in the territories, more than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska and Delaware combined. But still, no votes from the electoral college do they get. The whole situation with territories as extra strange when you consider the final group of Americans who don't live in the States, the 6.3 million Americans who live abroad. If you're a United States citizen who moves to a foreign country, you can usually send a postal vote to the last state that you resided in. But if you move within the United States to one of its territories, you lose your right to vote for president as long as you live there, making these the only spots in the whole earth where Americans are not allowed to vote for president. Actually, they're the only spots in the whole universe because American astronauts are allowed to vote from space.

The last bit of Electoral College complication is the weirdest and has to do with the votes themselves. The state of Florida and all the others don't really give votes to a candidate. That's just a simplified way to think about it because the reality of the situation is odd. What citizens are voting for on Election Day is a group of electors appointed by the political parties who choose the president on the citizens' behalf. The number of votes that a state gets from the electoral college is actually the number of electors the state is allowed to send to a collegiate meeting to vote on who the President will be. What makes it odd is that while these electors promised they will vote for president as their state citizens want them to, they aren't required to do so. Electors are free to vote the way they want. While this has never swung an election 87 times in the past, electors have voted against the wishes of the very people who elected them.

Why set up this crazy system where a small group of people essentially unknown to the general public are the ones who really decide on the president? Because in the 1700s, when the Electoral College was designed, the quickest way to send a piece of information was to write it down on a piece of paper, handed to a guy on a horse. Wish him Godspeed, good sir, and hope he didn't get killed by Indians or die of dysentery along the way. Because information moves so slowly. And because the young country was so big, the idea was to send all the electors to Washington where they could have the most up to date information to make decisions for the people back home who wouldn't know the latest news. Though Now when we carry information on beams of light and fiber optic cables rather than on the backs of herd animals. This particular aspect of the electoral college might seem a little out of date.

Nonetheless, while most people think that the election for president takes place in early November, it doesn't. That's the election that determines who the electors will be. The 538 electors who are chosen then meet in early December, and they cast the real votes that determine who is the next President of the United States.

> There have been instances throughout history where an elector has voted against the popular will or the instructions of their state. These instances are known as "==faithless electors==."
>
> One notable recent case occurred in the 2016 presidential election. Several electors, primarily from states won by Hillary Clinton, broke with tradition and voted for someone other than the candidate to whom they were pledged. This was a symbolic but ultimately inconsequential act, as it did not change the outcome of the election.
>
> To mitigate the potential for faithless electors, some states have passed laws binding their electors to vote in accordance with the popular vote result in that state. However, the legality and enforceability of such laws have been the subject of debate and legal challenges.
>
> Overall, while faithless electors are rare and typically have minimal impact on election outcomes, they serve as a reminder of the complexities and nuances of the electoral process.

The Electoral College comprises 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to elect the president. In terms of the number of electors, each state has the same number as in Congress: two senators per state plus the number of representatives. This means that each state has at least 3 electors, with additional electors determined by the state's population.

*Number of House Representatives:*

> The number of representatives in the House for each state is determined by the state's population, with each state guaranteed at least one representative. The total number of representatives in the House is capped at 435, with the remaining seats distributed among the states based on population changes measured in the national census conducted every ten years.

*Constitution:*

> Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

The winner is determined by whoever secures a majority in the electoral college. It's possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not secure the majority in the electoral college. This is due to the "winner takes all" system: Even if a candidate wins the popular vote in a state by a small margin, they can receive all the electoral college votes allocated to that state.

There are several implications to that system, one of them being that while most people are concentrated in the big states, only a few of those states are competitive (known as swing states or purple states). As a result, most of the time and money in the campaign is spent in these swing states, as they are the ones that ultimately decide the election.

The system also accounts for the fact that most voters are unlikely to waste their votes on third-party candidates (those not affiliated with the Democratic or Republican parties). However, in very close elections, it has been observed that these third-party candidates can play an important role in determining the outcome.

The majority of states adopt the "winner-takes-all" system, except for two states: Maine and Nebraska, which take into account some proportionality criteria.

> Maine: Maine allocates its electors using a proportional allocation method. Two electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote, representing the state's two U.S. Senate seats. The remaining two electoral votes are allocated based on the winner of the popular vote in each of Maine's two congressional districts. This means that Maine can potentially split its electoral votes between multiple candidates.
>
> Nebraska: Nebraska also uses a proportional allocation method for its electoral votes. Similar to Maine, two electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote, representing the state's two U.S. Senate seats. However, Nebraska has three congressional districts, so the remaining three electoral votes are allocated based on the winner of the popular vote in each of these districts. As with Maine, this means that Nebraska can potentially split its electoral votes between multiple candidates.

There have long been debates about whether the election of the president through the Electoral College should be continued or reformed, as some people consider it undemocratic. There have been attempts to change the system.

## The Presidential Election

The general election will take place on November 5th, 2024, and the Electoral College vote will occur on January 6th during a joint session of Congress.

The United States Capitol attack occurred on January 6, 2021, as the newly elected Senate and House convened to certify the Electoral College results of the 2020 presidential election.

> On January 6, 2021, a joint session of the United States Congress convened to certify the Electoral College results of the 2020 presidential election. However, this session was disrupted when a violent mob stormed the United States Capitol, resulting in the evacuation of lawmakers and a temporary halt to the proceedings. The mob breached the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the election results, leading to chaos and violence. Ultimately, order was restored, and Congress reconvened later that evening to resume the certification process. Despite the unprecedented events of the day, Congress certified the electoral votes, officially confirming Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.

The transition of power between the election of a new president and the time they take office can sometimes be challenging. If both the outgoing and incoming presidents are from the same party, the transition tends to be smoother. However, if they are from different parties, complications can arise. For instance, after Biden was elected, he faced delays in obtaining necessary information because Trump did not grant permission.
