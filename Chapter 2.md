### Caucus v. Primary?

The Constitution, state law, political party rules, and traditions shape the road to the White House.

> The text in the Constitution concerning presidential elections primarily appears in Article II, Sections 1, 2, and 3.
>
> - Article II, Section 1 outlines the process of electing the President and Vice President through the Electoral College.
> - Article II, Section 2 describes the powers and responsibilities of the President, including serving as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and granting pardons.
> - Article II, Section 3 details the duties of the President, such as delivering the State of the Union address and ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.
>
> Additionally, the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1804, modified the process for electing the President and Vice President by establishing separate Electoral College votes for each office.

In order to join the race for the presidency, candidates must first be nominated through caucuses and primaries. These candidates use the caucuses and primaries to test the waters and see if they stand a chance of becoming a candidate, assessing whether their candidacy is sufficient to raise money. Many of the initial candidates actually decide to drop out of the contest during the first phase of the election, with caucuses and primaries narrowing the field of candidates to one.

States are in charge of organizing primaries, and over time there have been two ways to what we refer to in a general way as “primaries”. We are currently in the primary phase. What is the difference between caucus and primary?

"Every four years, American states hold either a primary election or caucuses, part of which is to choose that state's top Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. So what's the difference between the two? Caucuses are elections run by political parties, while primaries are run by state governments. In an open primary, registered voters select whichever candidate they want regardless of party affiliation; in a closed primary, voters must be registered with a political party and they can only select a candidate within their selected party. But caucuses are different. In some caucuses, secret ballots are cast, while in others, people openly show support for their favorite candidate. Caucus-goers gather to debate issues and share concerns. Caucus-goers in Iowa's Democratic caucus gather in groups to support their chosen candidate. If after the first round of grouping, a candidate doesn't have 15% support, they are deemed nonviable, and supporters in their group must either join another candidate's group or convince caucus-goers in other groups to join theirs until 15% is reached. In the 2020 election cycle, primaries and caucuses will run through the early summer, but a party's nominee is usually apparent well before the caucuses and elections are completed. However, across the US, Democrats and Republicans won't officially nominate their candidate until the party's national conventions next summer."

>      - South Dakota: Uses a combination of primaries and conventions.
>      - Oregon: Conducts all voting by mail.
>      - Idaho: Holds closed primaries for presidential elections but caucuses for state elections.
>
> 2. **What is an open primary, closed primary, and semi-open primary?**
>
>    An open primary is a type of primary election in which voters are not required to declare their party affiliation and can choose to vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. In a closed primary, only voters who are registered members of a particular political party can participate and vote for candidates from that party. A semi-open primary is a hybrid of the two, where voters can choose to vote in either party's primary, but they may be required to publicly declare their party affiliation at the polling place.
>
> 3. **For states that have primaries only, do voters directly vote for their preferred presidential candidate, or do they vote for delegates?**
>
>    In states that have primaries only, voters directly vote for their preferred presidential candidate. The results of the primary determine the allocation of delegates to each candidate based on their share of the vote. These delegates then represent their candidate at the national party convention, where the party's nominee is officially chosen.
>
> 4. **For states that have primaries only, how are the exact delegates chosen?**
>
>    In states that have primaries only, the exact delegates are typically chosen through a process determined by each political party's rules. These rules often specify how delegates are allocated based on the results of the primary election. For example, delegates may be allocated proportionally to the candidates based on their share of the vote, or winner-takes-all in some cases. The specific method varies by state and party.
>
> 5. **What are the states where the winner takes all in the primary?**
>
>    States that operate under a "winner-takes-all" system in their primary elections include:
>
>    Florida, Ohio, Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey, Delaware, Missouri, District of Columbia, Montana (Republican)
>
>    Please note that these states may have variations in their winner-takes-all rules, such as awarding all delegates to the candidate who wins the statewide popular vote, or awarding delegates on a winner-takes-all basis within specific congressional districts.
>
> 6. **Is it state law or party rules that determine how delegates are allocated based on primary elections?**
>
>    Party rules typically determine how delegates are allocated based on primary elections. Each political party establishes its own rules for delegate allocation, which may vary from state to state. These rules govern factors such as whether delegates are allocated proportionally or on a winner-takes-all basis, the thresholds candidates must meet to receive delegates, and how uncommitted delegates are allocated. While state laws may have some influence, party rules generally have a more significant impact on delegate allocation.
>
> 7. **For states that have caucuses, how does it work?**
>
>    In states that have caucuses, the process typically involves voters gathering at local meetings to discuss and vote on their preferred presidential candidate. Caucus attendees may publicly express their support for a candidate, engage in debates, and participate in multiple rounds of voting if necessary. The results of the caucus determine the allocation of delegates to each candidate based on their level of support among caucus attendees. These delegates then represent their candidate at the party's county, district, and state conventions, ultimately leading to the selection of delegates to attend the national convention.
>
> 8. **Are primaries held at the state level or at the county and district level? What about caucuses?**
>
>    Primaries are typically held at the state level, where voters across the state participate in selecting their preferred presidential candidate. However, some states may also have primary elections at the county or district level for other political offices.
>
>    Caucuses, on the other hand, are usually held at the precinct or local level within a state. Voters gather in person at designated locations, such as schools or community centers, to participate in the caucus process and express their preferences for presidential candidates.
>
> 9. **In caucuses, do voters choose the presidential candidates or choose their delegates?**
>
>    In caucuses, voters typically participate in selecting both the presidential candidates and choosing delegates to represent them at subsequent party conventions. During the caucus process, voters express their preferences for presidential candidates, and the results determine the allocation of delegates to each candidate. These delegates then represent their candidate at county, district, and state conventions, ultimately leading to the selection of delegates to attend the national convention.
>
> 10. **If I want to be a delegate, what do I need to do?**
>
>     If you want to be a delegate, you typically need to get involved in the political party's process for selecting delegates. This often involves participating in local party meetings, precinct caucuses, or primary elections, where delegates are elected or selected to represent their area at higher levels of the party organization. You may need to express your interest in becoming a delegate and garner support from fellow party members to increase your chances of being selected. Additionally, understanding the rules and procedures set by the party for delegate selection can be crucial in navigating the process effectively.
>
> 11. **In a county or district, is there only one caucus meeting or multiple?**
>
>     In a county or district, there may be multiple caucus meetings held at different locations within the area. These meetings allow more voters to participate and ensure broader representation in the caucus process. The specific number of caucus meetings can vary depending on factors such as population size, geographic distribution, and party organization preferences.
>
> 12. **Who is eligible to attend a caucus meeting?**
>
>     Eligibility to attend a caucus meeting varies depending on the rules set by the political party and the state. Generally, individuals who are registered voters and affiliated with the party hosting the caucus are eligible to participate. However, some states allow same-day registration or participation regardless of party affiliation. It's essential to check the specific requirements set by the party and state to determine eligibility for attending a caucus meeting.
>
> 13. **How can one ensure that a voter does not attend caucus meetings multiple times at different locations? How can one ensure that individuals affiliated with another party do not participate in the caucus meeting?**
>
>     To prevent a voter from attending caucus meetings multiple times at different locations, caucus organizers typically maintain voter registration lists or check-in procedures to verify each attendee's eligibility and participation status. This helps ensure that individuals cannot attend multiple caucus meetings simultaneously.
>
>     To prevent individuals affiliated with another party from participating in the caucus meeting, caucus organizers may require attendees to provide proof of party affiliation or voter registration with the hosting party. Additionally, some states have closed caucuses, where only registered members of the party can participate, further ensuring that individuals from other parties do not attend. Organizers may also implement check-in procedures to verify party affiliation before allowing participation in the caucus.
>
> 14. **What is a closed caucus and what is an open caucus?**
>
>     A closed caucus is a type of caucus where only registered members of the political party hosting the caucus are allowed to participate. Participants must be affiliated with the party to attend and vote in the caucus proceedings.
>
>     An open caucus, on the other hand, is a type of caucus where eligible voters, regardless of party affiliation, are allowed to participate. In open caucuses, individuals may attend and vote in the caucus proceedings without being required to be registered members of the hosting party.
>
> 15. **If I want to be a member of the Democratic Party , what should I do?**
>
>     To become a member of the Democratic Party, you typically need to register as a Democrat with your state's election office or board of elections. The process for registering may vary depending on your state's laws and regulations. In some states, you can register online, while in others, you may need to submit a paper registration form by mail or in person. You can usually find registration information and forms on your state's election website or by contacting your local election office.
>
> 16. **Who makes speeches for the presidential candidates during caucus meetings?**
>
>     During caucus meetings, supporters or representatives of presidential candidates typically make speeches advocating for their preferred candidate. These speeches aim to persuade undecided caucus participants and gather support for their candidate. The speakers may highlight the candidate's qualifications, policy positions, and accomplishments to sway caucus-goers. Additionally, candidates themselves may attend caucus meetings to deliver speeches and engage directly with voters.
>
> 17. **For states with a combination of primaries and caucuses, how does it work?**
>
>     In states with a combination of primaries and caucuses, the process can vary depending on the specific rules established by the political party and the state. Generally, some areas within the state may hold primary elections, where voters cast their ballots in a manner similar to general elections. In other areas, caucus meetings may be held, where voters gather to discuss and vote on their preferred presidential candidate.
>
>     The combination approach allows for flexibility in the nomination process and may reflect the preferences of different regions within the state. It can also provide opportunities for broader participation and engagement among party members. The specific details of how primaries and caucuses are conducted in these states are determined by party rules, state laws, and party organization preferences.
>
> 18. **For states that use a combination of primaries and conventions, how does it work? How does it differ from a general primary?**
>
>     In states that use a combination of primaries and conventions, the process typically involves both a primary election and a subsequent convention where delegates are selected.
>
>     During the primary election, voters cast their ballots to determine the allocation of delegates to each presidential candidate. These delegates are usually bound to support a specific candidate based on the primary results.
>
>     Following the primary, a convention is held where delegates from each candidate's campaign or supporters gather to formally elect delegates to represent them at the national convention. This convention may involve additional rounds of voting or negotiations to determine the final allocation of delegates.
>
>     The key difference from a general primary is the inclusion of a convention component, where delegates are formally selected to represent each candidate at the national level. This process allows for further deliberation and organization within the party before the final selection of delegates to the national convention.
>
> 19. **What's the condition for a candidate to have their name on the primary ballot?**
>
>     To have their name on the primary ballot, a candidate typically needs to meet certain eligibility requirements set by state law. These requirements often include gathering a certain number of signatures from registered voters, paying a filing fee, and submitting necessary paperwork by a specified deadline. Additionally, candidates may need to meet other qualifications such as being a registered member of the party for which they seek nomination.
>
> 20. **During primaries, can voters vote for someone who is not on the ballot?**
>
>     During primaries, voters typically can only choose from the candidates listed on the ballot. Write-in candidates are not usually allowed in primary elections, although this can vary depending on state laws and party rules.

The similarity between caucuses and primaries is that both procedures are indirect. In both, party voters choose delegates to represent them at the national convention, where the official nomination of a candidate takes place. These delegates are given the authority to make the nomination decision on behalf of the voters. While voters may know which candidate a delegate supports, the primary result is ultimately an indirect outcome, as it is the delegates who formally make the nomination decision. This indirect process can sometimes lead to confusion when interpreting the primary results.

Most states use the primary system, which results in 80% of the convention delegates. This system typically receives more media attention due to its widespread use and influence in determining the nomination outcome. However, there are a few states where caucuses are used instead of primaries.

Caucuses are meetings organized by political parties, where participants physically gather in a room and split into groups according to the candidate they support.

Primaries are held at the state level and allow citizens to vote for their candidate anonymously by casting a secret vote. There are differences between the types of primaries. Most primaries are **closed primaries**, meaning that only registered members of a specific party can participate. In states with closed primaries, separate elections are held for Republicans and Democrats. There are also **open primaries**, where voters from any party can participate. Additionally, there is a **third type** where voters from different parties and independents can participate.

> The rules regarding independent voters' participation in primary elections vary depending on the state and the type of primary being held. In some states with open primaries, independent voters are allowed to participate and vote for candidates regardless of party affiliation. However, in states with closed primaries, only registered members of a specific party can participate, so independent voters may not be able to vote unless they affiliate with a party. Semi-open primaries may allow independent voters to participate, but it depends on the specific rules of each state. It's essential to check your state's laws and regulations regarding primary elections to determine if you, as an independent voter, can participate in open, closed, or semi-open primaries.

### The 2020 Democratic Primaries

Regarding the number of candidates, it always decreases during the initial phase, as seen in the 2020 Democratic primaries. At the beginning, there were 25 candidates. When voting began for the first caucuses, only 11 remained in the race, with many exiting before the voting phase. Between the first caucuses and Super Tuesday (the day when many primaries are held), several candidates ended their campaigns, and others dropped out after the results of Super Tuesday. In April, Sanders left the race, leaving Biden as the sole remaining candidate.

Most relevant who participated in the primary debates:

- 2 liberal Democrats:
  - Bernie Sanders (Senator - VT)
  - Elizabeth Warren (Senator – MA)
- 4 moderate Democrats:
  - Joe Biden (Former VP)
  - Michael Bloomberg (former NYC mayor)
  - Pete Buttigieg (Mayor)
  - Amy Klobuchar (Senator)

### 2024 Presidential Election

#### Timeline of the 2024 Presidential Election

- Currently: Democratic and Republican primaries
  - March 5^th^: Super Tuesday, the biggest single day of primaries
- June 4^th^: final state primaries
- July 15-18: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate
- August 19-22: Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the party formally chooses its candidate
- September 16^th^: date set by the Commission on Presidential Debates for the 1st presidential debates (at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas)
- General election: November 5^th^, 2024
- January 6^th^, 2025: Electoral College Vote

#### The Democratic Primary

If we look at the Democratic primary, the three major candidates are Joe Biden, Dean Phillips, and Marianne Williamson. The results of the presidential primary showed 96.2% support for Biden, indicating that the other two candidates had very low chances of remaining in the race for long.

#### The Republican Primary

A situation similar to the 2020 Democratic primaries occurred, where initially, several candidates were in the race but eventually dropped out. The last major candidate to drop out was Roe DeSantis. While some delegates supported other candidates, their numbers were significantly lower compared to the major candidates.

#### The Fifth Republican Presidential Primary Debate

During the primary season, there are televised debates in which various candidates discuss their respective ideas. However, Trump acts separately and does not participate in debates with other candidates.

- Trump: Hi, Brett.
- Host: Mr. President. Thank you very much.
- Haley: Rather than have him go and tell you all these lies, you can go to DeSantisLies.com. But every time he lies, Drake University, don't turn this into a drinking game because you will be overserved by the end of the night.
- DeSantis: Nikki Haley has this tactic. If you hold her accountable to her record, first she'll say, "I never said that." Well, one good rule of thumb -- if she says she's never said something, that definitely means she said it. now that she's getting scrutiny, she's got this problem with ballistic podiatry, shooting herself in the foot every other day.
- Haley: Ron's lying because Ron's losing. Everybody in the country sees it for what it is.
- Trump: I have polls that show me leading by a tremendous amount in New Hampshire and a lot in Iowa, and nationwide, we're leading by almost 60 points, so I'm not exactly worried about it.
- DeSantis: Donald Trump's running to pursue his issues. Nikki Haley is running to pursue her donors' issues. I'm running to pursue your issues.
- Moderator: Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be president again?
- Haley: Well, I think the next president needs to have moral clarity. I wish Donald Trump was up here on this stage. He's the one that I'm running against
- DeSantis: Donald Trump should be on this stage. He owes it to you here in Iowa.
- Trump: I'm not going to have time for retribution. We're going to make this country so successful again, I'm not gonna have time for retribution. And remember this -- our ultimate retribution is success.

## The Conventions

The national convention is where party delegates pick their official candidate. There are two separate conventions for each party.

Now that there is no doubt about the result of the conventions (Biden for Democratic and Trump for Republican), the role of the national conventions has changed. It is a place where candidates rally around someone, though what people mostly see is opposition between candidates of the same party.

The conventions served as an opportunity for party members to gather and discuss the party's platform: the ideas the candidate is going to defend in the elections. For a long time, the convention was an important venue for political debate and decision-making.

Now, both conventions are televised events. They are essentially media shows aimed at demonstrating that the internal disagreements of the primary season are over and convincing the public to identify with a nominee. The party conventions offer competing media presentations of their ideas and candidates. The key question during the national convention is which of these appeals will be more successful at convincing the public which candidate is better.

Two types of delegates exist:

- ==Pledged delegates==: The majority of delegates fall into this category. They are required to respect the results of the primary season, including primaries and caucuses.

- ==Unpledged delegates==: The minority of delegates fall into this category. They are not obligated to follow the aforementioned rule.

When a delegate votes, they cast their vote for a presidential ticket, simultaneously voting for the presidential candidate and their vice-presidential running mate.

After the elections, debates are organized between the candidates. This year, the first presidential debate will be on September 16th. Debates are organized by a variety of groups, including universities for the first debates. The campaign ends on November 5th, 2024, the day of the elections. There are also indirect presidential elections in which voters select the members of the electoral college.

> Q&A:
>
> 1. **How many delegates are there in total at the Democratic National Convention? And how many are there in the Republican? How many of the delegates are pledged delegates, and how many are unpledged delegates?**
>
>    - Democrats: In 2024, there are an estimated 4,672 delegates: 3,933 (84%) pledged delegates and 739 (16%) automatic delegates (more commonly known as superdelegates).
>
>    - Republicans: In 2024, there are an estimated 2,429 delegates: 2,325 (96%) pledged delegates and 104 (4%) unpledged delegates.
>
> 2. **Does the number of delegates at the national convention vary with each election?**
>
>    Yes, the number of delegates at the national convention can vary with each election. Factors such as changes in party rules, the results of primaries and caucuses, and adjustments made by the parties themselves can all affect the total number of delegates participating in the convention. Additionally, the inclusion of unpledged delegates, such as superdelegates in the Democratic Party, can also contribute to variations in the total delegate count from one election to another.
>
>    - Democrats:
>      - 2020 election: 4,750 delegates, including 3,979 pledged delegates and 771 automatic delegates
>      - 2024 election: 4,672 delegates, including 3,933 pledged delegates and 739 automatic delegates
>    - Republicans:
>      - 2020 election: 2,551 delegates, including 2,441 pledged delegates and 110 unpledged delegates
>      - 2024 election: 2,429 delegates, including 2,325 pledged delegates and 104 unpledged delegates
>
> 3. **How are the delegates distributed?**
>
>    - Democrats:
>
>      The number of delegates awarded to each state is determined by a formula that factors the state's popular vote for the Democratic nominee in the previous three elections, the state's electoral votes, and when the state's primary is held.
>
>      The pledged delegate "base" allocation is determined by the jurisdiction's Presidential vote in 2012, 2016, and 2020; and the jurisdiction's electoral vote allocation based on 2020 census. Jurisdictions beginning their process later in the cycle and neighboring states that concurrently begin their process (aka "clustering") receive bonus delegates.
>
>      The unpledged PLEO Democratic (aka Automatic) Delegates consist of Democratic Governors (and the Mayor of DC), Democratic U.S. House members, Democratic U.S. Senators (and the Statehood Senators of DC); DNC members; and distinguished party leaders (current and former Democratic Presidents, Democratic leadership of the U.S. House and Senate, and Chairpersons of the DNC) [Call to Convention IV.B.1.].
>
>    - Republicans:
>
>      - Pledged delegates
>
>        - **Pledged district delegates** are distributed and elected at the congressional district level. The Republican Party assigns three district-level delegates to each congressional district.
>
>        - **Pledged at-large delegates** are distributed and elected statewide. The Republican Party assigns 10 at-large delegates to each state.
>
>        - **Pledged party leaders**: The Republican Party gives delegate status to three party leaders from each state and territory—its national committeeman, national committeewoman, and state party chair.
>
>        - **Pledged bonus delegates**: Bonus delegates are assigned to states whose electoral votes went to the Republican nominee in the last presidential election and to states in which Republicans hold: the governorship, at least half of U.S. representative seats, a majority of a state legislative chamber, a majority of seats in both legislative chambers, or a U.S. Senate seat (elected within the past six years).
>
>      - Unpledged delegates
>
>         Some state and territory party rules dictate that some or all of their Republican delegates are unbound. Pennsylvania's 51 district-level delegates are not bound to support any particular presidential candidate. All 29 of North Dakota's Republican delegates are unpledged. Wyoming's three party leader delegates are unpledged. All 18 delegates from American Samoa (9) and Guam (9) are unpledged. The Virgin Islands' three party leader delegates are also unpledged.
>
> 4. **What are the conditions for a candidate to be declared the winner?**
>
>    - Democrats:

>      To win the Democratic nomination, a presidential candidate needs to receive support from a majority of the pledged delegates on the first ballot: an estimated 1,968 pledged delegates (50% plus one).
>
>       If the convention is contested and goes to a second ballot or more, automatic delegates—commonly referred to as superdelegates—are able to vote and a candidate must receive majority support from all delegates—2,258 votes (?). Previously, superdelegates were able to vote on the first ballot. This rule changed after the 2016 presidential election, when the Unity Reform Commission proposed several ways to reduce the number and power of superdelegates.

>      To win the Republican nomination, a presidential candidate must receive support from a majority of delegates—an estimated 1,215 delegates.

## The Electoral College

In the US, the popular vote, which counts the number of supporters for candidates, and the Electoral College votes are two separate things. Despite people voting for candidates and not electors directly, networks often display maps of the country that track the number of electoral votes to be assigned, rather than the popular vote.

### Why the Framers created the Electoral College?

“It was [...] desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to so complicated an investigation.” (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist, No. 68)

Instead of a large mass of potentially misinformed voters, there will be a small number of electors.

### How does the Electoral College work?

"Election Day when Americans everywhere cast their ballot for the next President of the United States, except not really, Americans don't directly vote for president. It's a bit complicated because of something called the Electoral College, think of the Electoral College as the collection of 538 votes that determine who the President of the United States will be. Why 538? Because that's the number of senators 100 plus a number of representatives 438. And Congress. These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't given to the citizens directly, but are instead divided among the states. Each state no matter how populous or not gets three votes to start, the remaining votes are given out roughly in proportion to the population of the states, the more people the state has, the more votes it gets.

In early November, when citizens go to the polls, they aren't voting for president directly, but they're really telling their state how they want it to use its electoral votes. 48 of the 50 states give all their electoral college votes to the candidate who wins a majority in their state. Take Florida, for example, which has 29 Electoral College votes. If a candidate wins a majority, no matter how small that majority, he gets all the votes. So the path to the White House is clear, when enough majorities and enough states to get more than half of the Electoral College votes and you get to sit at the big desk.

There were a few details left out. The Electoral College love states, but what about the 11 million Americans who don't live in a state? What happens to their vote? And where are these people hiding? There were about 600,000 in the District of Columbia and area set aside specifically not to be a state so that the capital of the country would be free of local politics. For most of the United States history, people living in the district didn't get to vote for president. Then in 1964, the Constitution was amended to give DC the same number of votes as the least populous state, Wyoming. So the Electoral College likes DC, but you know who doesn't like? The territories, the often forgotten Puerto Rico Guam, US Virgin Islands in Northern Mariana Islands get no votes from the Electoral College because they aren't states and they don't have a special constitutional amendment to recognize them. Which is a bit odd considering they're part of the United States and everyone who lives there as a citizen. So for most practical purposes, they're just like DC. 4.4 million people live in the territories, more than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska and Delaware combined. But still, no votes from the electoral college do they get. The whole situation with territories as extra strange when you consider the final group of Americans who don't live in the States, the 6.3 million Americans who live abroad. If you're a United States citizen who moves to a foreign country, you can usually send a postal vote to the last state that you resided in. But if you move within the United States to one of its territories, you lose your right to vote for president as long as you live there, making these the only spots in the whole earth where Americans are not allowed to vote for president. Actually, they're the only spots in the whole universe because American astronauts are allowed to vote from space.

The last bit of Electoral College complication is the weirdest and has to do with the votes themselves. The state of Florida and all the others don't really give votes to a candidate. That's just a simplified way to think about it because the reality of the situation is odd. What citizens are voting for on Election Day is a group of electors appointed by the political parties who choose the president on the citizens' behalf. The number of votes that a state gets from the electoral college is actually the number of electors the state is allowed to send to a collegiate meeting to vote on who the President will be. What makes it odd is that while these electors promised they will vote for president as their state citizens want them to, they aren't required to do so. Electors are free to vote the way they want. While this has never swung an election 87 times in the past, electors have voted against the wishes of the very people who elected them.

Why set up this crazy system where a small group of people essentially unknown to the general public are the ones who really decide on the president? Because in the 1700s, when the Electoral College was designed, the quickest way to send a piece of information was to write it down on a piece of paper, handed to a guy on a horse. Wish him Godspeed, good sir, and hope he didn't get killed by Indians or die of dysentery along the way. Because information moves so slowly. And because the young country was so big, the idea was to send all the electors to Washington where they could have the most up to date information to make decisions for the people back home who wouldn't know the latest news. Though Now when we carry information on beams of light and fiber optic cables rather than on the backs of herd animals. This particular aspect of the electoral college might seem a little out of date.

Nonetheless, while most people think that the election for president takes place in early November, it doesn't. That's the election that determines who the electors will be. The 538 electors who are chosen then meet in early December, and they cast the real votes that determine who is the next President of the United States."

> There have been instances throughout history where an elector has voted against the popular will or the instructions of their state. These instances are known as "==faithless electors==."
>
> One notable recent case occurred in the 2016 presidential election. Several electors, primarily from states won by Hillary Clinton, broke with tradition and voted for someone other than the candidate to whom they were pledged. This was a symbolic but ultimately inconsequential act, as it did not change the outcome of the election.
>
> To mitigate the potential for faithless electors, some states have passed laws binding their electors to vote in accordance with the popular vote result in that state. However, the legality and enforceability of such laws have been the subject of debate and legal challenges.
>
> Overall, while faithless electors are rare and typically have minimal impact on election outcomes, they serve as a reminder of the complexities and nuances of the electoral process.

The Electoral College comprises 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to elect the president. In terms of the number of electors, each state has the same number as in Congress: two senators per state plus the number of representatives. This means that each state has at least 3 electors, with additional electors determined by the state's population.

*Number of House Representatives:*

> The number of representatives in the House for each state is determined by the state's population, with each state guaranteed at least one representative. The total number of representatives in the House is capped at 435, with the remaining seats distributed among the states based on population changes measured in the national census conducted every ten years.

*Constitution:*

> Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

The winner is determined by whoever secures a majority in the electoral college. It's possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not secure the majority in the electoral college. This is due to the "winner takes all" system: Even if a candidate wins the popular vote in a state by a small margin, they can receive all the electoral college votes allocated to that state.

There are several implications to that system, one of them being that while most people are concentrated in the big states, only a few of those states are competitive (known as swing states or purple states). As a result, most of the time and money in the campaign is spent in these swing states, as they are the ones that ultimately decide the election.

The system also accounts for the fact that most voters are unlikely to waste their votes on third-party candidates (those not affiliated with the Democratic or Republican parties). However, in very close elections, it has been observed that these third-party candidates can play an important role in determining the outcome.

The majority of states adopt the "winner-takes-all" system, except for two states: Maine and Nebraska, which take into account some proportionality criteria.

> Maine: Maine allocates its electors using a proportional allocation method. Two electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote, representing the state's two U.S. Senate seats. The remaining two electoral votes are allocated based on the winner of the popular vote in each of Maine's two congressional districts. This means that Maine can potentially split its electoral votes between multiple candidates.
>
> Nebraska: Nebraska also uses a proportional allocation method for its electoral votes. Similar to Maine, two electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote, representing the state's two U.S. Senate seats. However, Nebraska has three congressional districts, so the remaining three electoral votes are allocated based on the winner of the popular vote in each of these districts. As with Maine, this means that Nebraska can potentially split its electoral votes between multiple candidates.

There have long been debates about whether the election of the president through the Electoral College should be continued or reformed, as some people consider it undemocratic. There have been attempts to change the system.

> Q&A:
>
> 1. **During the popular vote, must voters vote for the candidate who is from the party the voter affiliated with when he registered for the primary?**
>
>    No, voters are not required to vote for the candidate who is from the party they affiliated with when registering for the primary. In most cases, voters can vote for any candidate, regardless of party affiliation, during the general election.
>
> 2. **During the general election, can voters vote for someone who is not the party's nominee or even not the candidate in the primary?**
>
>    Yes, during the general election, voters can write in the name of any candidate, regardless of whether they were the party's nominee or participated in the primary election.

## The Presidential Election

The general election will take place on November 5^th^, 2024, and the Electoral College vote will occur on January 6th during a joint session of Congress.

The United States Capitol attack occurred on January 6, 2021, as the newly elected Senate and House convened to certify the Electoral College results of the 2020 presidential election.

> On January 6, 2021, a joint session of the United States Congress convened to certify the Electoral College results of the 2020 presidential election. However, this session was disrupted when a violent mob stormed the United States Capitol, resulting in the evacuation of lawmakers and a temporary halt to the proceedings. The mob breached the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the election results, leading to chaos and violence. Ultimately, order was restored, and Congress reconvened later that evening to resume the certification process. Despite the unprecedented events of the day, Congress certified the electoral votes, officially confirming Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.

The transition of power between the election of a new president and the time they take office can sometimes be challenging. If both the outgoing and incoming presidents are from the same party, the transition tends to be smoother. However, if they are from different parties, complications can arise. For instance, after Biden was elected, he faced delays in obtaining necessary information because Trump did not grant permission.

There is a term used to refer to the president who is leaving office: a lame-duck president. This term implies that the outgoing president doesn't have a lot of power during this period.

> A "lame duck" president refers to the period of time between when a new president has been elected and the outgoing president's term ends. During this time, the outgoing president may have limited power or influence because they are no longer eligible for re-election and their successor has been chosen. This term is often used to describe a president whose authority is diminished or who is seen as having less political clout during this transitional period.

## The Role of Money in Elections

"The Clintons, from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions. So how did Hillary end up filthy rich? Pay to play politics. Staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America. Hillary cut deals for donors, sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need. She even handed over American uranium rights to the Russians. Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself. I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message."

There is a lot of money spent on campaigns, especially on political ads in the media. There are two types of ads: Either accretive ads praising the candidate, or attack ads targeting the opponent, also known as negative ads.

In 1974, after Watergate brought down President Nixon, Congress made important amendments to the Federal Election Campaign with the goal of reforming American campaign finance. The amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971 were made to:

- Create the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
- Require disclosure of donor information
- Place limits on the amount of money that individuals & political action committees (PACs) could make directly to candidates (Those donations made directly to candidates are referred to as “==hard money==”)
- Create a system of public financing for presidential elections
- Place limits on the amount of money that individuals could spend on their own campaigns

The intent was to create a level playing field for all candidates. This limitation was added to restrictions passed earlier by Congress, which banned corporations (Tillman Act, 1907) and labor unions (Taft-Hartley Act, 1947) from funding federal campaigns.

> The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal in the United States during the 1970s. It involved the break-in and subsequent cover-up of illegal activities undertaken by members of President Richard Nixon's administration. The scandal came to light in 1972 when five men were arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. As investigations unfolded, it was revealed that the break-in was part of a broader campaign of political sabotage and espionage conducted by Nixon's reelection campaign. The scandal ultimately led to Nixon's resignation in 1974, making him the only U.S. president to resign from office. The Watergate scandal had far-reaching implications for American politics, leading to reforms in campaign finance laws, government transparency, and the powers of the presidency.

The donations made indirectly to political parties (known as ==soft money==) were not regulated by the FECA. There were significant increases in the amount of contributions made indirectly to the parties, as no limits were attached.

> Hard money refers to contributions made directly to a specific candidate or campaign committee and is subject to federal regulations and contribution limits. These contributions are used to fund activities such as advertising, voter mobilization efforts, and other campaign expenses.
>
> Soft money, on the other hand, refers to contributions made to political parties or other organizations for activities that are not directly related to supporting a specific candidate's campaign, such as party-building activities or issue advocacy. Soft money contributions are not subject to the same federal regulations and contribution limits as hard money contributions, making them a way to circumvent campaign finance laws. However, soft money usage has been restricted by various campaign finance reforms over the years.

Soft money spent in presidential election:

- $86 million in 1992
- $260 million in 1996
- $750 million in 2000

In response to the surge in indirect contributions to political parties, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002, commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act, was enacted. Sponsored by Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold, this legislation aimed to regulate campaign financing more tightly. It introduced restrictions on "electioneering communications," which included ads that mentioned candidates within a specific timeframe before elections. Additionally, the act mandated that political ads include a disclaimer stating "I approve this message" at both the beginning and the end of the advertisement. These measures were implemented to enhance transparency and accountability in political advertising.

> The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also known as the McCain–Feingold Act, is a United States federal law that was enacted in 2002. It aimed to reform the campaign finance system by imposing restrictions on political contributions and advertising. The BCRA banned "soft money" contributions to national political parties, limited the use of corporate and union funds for campaign ads, and required disclosure of donors for certain types of political advertising. Additionally, it introduced the "stand by your ad" provision, which required candidates to appear in their campaign ads and state that they approved the message. The law aimed to reduce the influence of money in politics and increase transparency in campaign funding.

In 2008, Citizens United, a non-profit corporation that criticized Hillary Clinton, sought to air a film critical of her during the presidential election campaign. When prevented from doing so by existing campaign finance laws, they took their case to court, challenging the law and suing the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

### Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)

"‘Bad for you, bad for America!’ ‘He'll put us back on track.’ ‘… ran our state into the ground; now he wants to be your senator.’ ‘Stand up! Say No!’ ‘Stand up and say no!’ ‘Bad for you, bad for America!’ ‘Vote for this guy!’ ‘Vote for this guy!’

Aren't you tired of this stuff? Why is it that every election season, it becomes impossible to hear the facts over all these misleading ads? And if it seems the problem is only getting worse, that's because it is. We can thank the Supreme Court for that. In 2010, they decided that it'd be just fine for corporations to spend as much money as they want, telling us who to vote for.

Wait, why are corporations telling us who to vote for? Let's get something straight. This is a democracy, you know, rule by the people? I'm a person. You're a person. And Chevron? Not a person. So shouldn't elections be all about what people want? Good jobs, safe products, healthcare, responsible government, clean air and water... It turns out that the vast majority of Americans want to see a lot more done on all of these things. But what people want will take a backseat as long as corporations can spend millions getting lawmakers elected. Oil companies have gotten politicians to block laws protecting our climate. Manufacturers have pushed through trade agreements that gut product safety and help ship jobs overseas. Insurance companies have been the first ones consulted on health reform, and giant corporations have gotten bailouts and subsidies.

Maybe that's why all kinds of people—Republicans, Democrats, Independents—are totally frustrated with our government. It's easy to get angry. But it's time we got smart and realized that the heart of our problem is not that we have bad lawmakers. We have a democracy in crisis. 85% of Americans feel that corporations have too much power in our democracy and people have too little. 85 percent! Hey, that's a majority. So let's get together and take our democracy back from corporations. It's the first and most important step in making real progress on all the issues people care most about.

So how did "we the people" lose control of our democracy to begin with? Let's go back a few centuries. Back then, there were just people. Some of them owned businesses. Some of them worked for businesses. Still, there were just people. Then people invented something entirely new—the corporation. These legal entities exist independently of the people who own them. If a corporation does something that gets it into trouble, the owners can say, Don't blame me, blame the corporation. I'm just a shareholder! When the United States came into existence, corporations were easier to keep in check. Back then, the government would grant them charters for a specific short-term project, like building a bridge or a railroad. Once they fulfilled their purpose, they were disbanded. But over time, the law changed, and corporations no longer had to be turned off once their project was complete. They began to live on indefinitely, with a much more general purpose: profit. And that's how the modern corporation was born.

Today's corporations have evolved to have something very dangerous in their programming. Unlike people, who are driven by all kinds of motivations—doing the right thing, love for family, their country, the planet—publicly traded corporations are now required by law and the markets to pursue one single motivation above all others. Maximize value for shareholders—make as much money as possible. That's it. No, really, that's what the law and the markets demand. Imagine a friend saying, ‘The only thing I really care about is money.’ Not someone you'd want to leave your kids with, or your democracy for that matter. Yes, it is people who run these corporations, but their human motivations come second. If they prioritize anything at all over maximizing profits, they're outta there. Can corporate leaders do good things like give to charity or try to be more green? Sure. But not if it conflicts with maximum profits. And since their humble beginnings, corporations have grown huge. 53 of the 100 biggest economies on earth are now corporations. So corporations have a single-minded profit motive. They're humungous. And their owners can easily dodge the blame for any harm they cause. That makes them tricky to share a country with. If we want them to serve us and not the other way around, they need some basic ground rules. And that's where the government comes in, setting rules to keep things fair and safe and to protect society from corporations running amok.

Now if their main objective is to maximize profit, do you think corporations are content to follow rules that keep them in check? No, of course not. They want to write those rules. But who is supposed to write the rules in a democracy? People. That's why one of the corporations' key strategies for sneaking into our democracy is saying they should have the same First Amendment rights as real, live people. And that's exactly how they won that 2010 Supreme Court case known as Citizens United vs. FEC.

In that case, five members of the Supreme Court decided that it's unconstitutional to put any limits on how much money corporations can spend influencing elections. Why? They said these limits violate the First Amendment guaranteeing free speech. Obviously, our founding fathers, who wrote the First Amendment, were trying to protect the free speech of people. But this decision rides on the crazy argument that corporations should be treated the same as people and should get the same rights real people get! This means corporations can spend as much as they want whenever they want to intimidate or crush candidates running on a platform against their interests and support candidates who will do what they ask. Great news for corporations wanting to handpick the lawmakers whose job it is to keep them in check.

Now, I'm all for free speech! If every shareholder and employee at Exxon wants to personally support some oil lobbyist running for senate, it's their right. There are millions more people who will support a different candidate. That's democracy in action! But now Exxon or any other corporation can decide to spend unlimited dollars from its huge corporate coffers to influence an election without even consulting its shareholders. This is a big deal. If the top 100 corporations decided to throw in just 1% of their profits, they could outspend every candidate for President, House, and Senate combined! Good luck having your free speech heard over that! So did opening the floodgates with this money actually cause a flood? Sure did. In 2010, the kind of "independent groups" that corporations are now allowed to support spent $300 million. That's more than every midterm election since 1990 combined! So corporations are drowning out our voices, getting what they want, and our democracy is in trouble.

But we can totally save it! People are so outraged by the Supreme Court decision that a massive response is mobilizing. Such a huge problem requires a huge solution, and we've got one: a new constitutional amendment. The amendment is smart and clear. It reverses this disaster for our democracy by clarifying that the First Amendment isn't meant for for-profit corporations. I get that amending the constitution is a big, ambitious goal. But it's not impossible. Every time huge positive change has been made in this country, it's because people dreamed big, aimed high, and set ambitious goals. It's time to do that now, because the life of our democracy is on the line. Public financing of campaigns would be another huge step forward. Congress is working on a bill right now that would make it possible for candidates to get elected without corporate dollars. Remember, 85% of Americans think that corporations have too much influence in our democracy. That's enough to make change if we can turn that sentiment into action. Look, the corporations won't get out of our democracy until we, the people, get back in. So keep fighting for renewable energy, green jobs, health care, safe products, and top-notch public education. But save some energy for the battle of our lifetimes, a battle that can open the door to solving all of these things. It's time to put corporations back in their place and to put people back in charge of our democracy."

### Holding of Citizens United v. FEC (2010)

Citizens United sued the Federal Election Commission, and in 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) issued its decision. With a majority of 5 out of the 9 judges, the SCOTUS ruled that political spending must be considered a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. While corporations cannot directly contribute money to campaigns, they can still influence the public through other means, such as spending money on advertisements to support or criticize candidates. This decision means that the government cannot restrict corporations' rights to spend money on producing ads that attack opponents. Consequently, there are no limitations on soft money.

The result of the Supreme Court decision was an increase in soft money because it was advantageous for companies to do so. The 2012 presidential election was the first to follow the 2010 decision, and it saw more than twice the amount of political spending. That case demonstrated that the Supreme Court is a major actor in the American political system and a powerful one.

### Obama on Citizens United

"You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with the campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. He called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case."

"Well, the latest case would go even further than Citizens United, essentially saying anything goes. There are no rules in terms of how to finance campaigns. There aren't a lot of functioning democracies around the world that work this way, where you can basically have millionaires and billionaires bankrolling whoever they want, however they want, in some cases undisclosed. And what it means is ordinary Americans are shut out of the process. And Democrats aren't entirely innocent of this in the past. I had to raise a lot of money for my campaign, so there's nobody who operates in politics that has perfectly clean hands on this issue. But what is also true is that all of us should bind ourselves to some rules that say the people who vote for us should be more important than somebody who's spending a million dollars, 10 million dollars, or a hundred million dollars to help us get elected. Because we don't know what their agendas are, we don't know what their interests are. And I continue to believe that Citizens United contributed to some of the problems we're having in Washington right now. You know, you have some ideological extremists who have a big bankroll and they can entirely skew our politics. And there are a whole bunch of members of Congress right now who privately will tell you, "I know our positions are unreasonable, but we're scared that if we don't go along with the Tea Party agenda or some particularly extremist agenda, that we'll be challenged from the right." And the threats are very explicit. So they tow the line. And that's part of why we've seen a breakdown of just normal routine business done here in Washington on behalf of the American people. And all of you know it. I mean, I'm not telling you anything you don't know because it's very explicit. You report on it. A big chunk of the Republican Party right now is in gerrymandered districts where there's no competition. And those folks are much more worried about a Tea Party challenger than they are about a general election where they've got to compete against a Democrat or go after independent votes. And in that environment, it's a lot harder for them to compromise."

> The Tea Party is a political movement in the United States that emerged in the early 2000s, characterized by its conservative and libertarian principles. It advocates for limited government, fiscal responsibility, and adherence to the Constitution. The movement gained momentum through grassroots activism and played a significant role in shaping the political landscape, particularly within the Republican Party.

### John McCain on Citizens United

- Host: You have long been passionate about the idea of restricting the amount of money that flows into campaigns, but in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, Citizens United, we are seeing enormous sums of money going into these campaigns, both to the campaigns themselves and to outside supporters. And is it just inevitable that we're now in a period where money is going to be playing this dominant role in American politics?

- McCain: I'm afraid at least for the time being, that's going to be the case because of the most misguided, naive, uninformed, egregious decision of the United States Supreme Court, I think in the 21^st^ century, to somehow view money as not having an effect on election corrupting affection fact on election flies in the face of reality. I just wish one of them had run for county sheriff.

- Host: One of the justice...

- McCain: One of the five Supreme Court justices voted to invalidate what we know as McCain-Feingold. But I guarantee you, Judy, there will be scandals; there's too much money washing around political campaigns today. It will take scandals, and then maybe we can have the Supreme Court go back and revisit this issue. Remember, the Supreme Court rules on constitutionality, so just passing another law doesn't get it. So I'm afraid we're in for a very bleak period in American politics. You know, we all talk about, as you just did, how much money is in the presidential campaign. Suppose there's a Senate campaign in a small state, and 10 people get together and decide to contribute $10 million each. You think that wouldn't affect that Senate campaign?

- Host: This question of campaign money is highlighted today by the announcement that there's a huge amount of money coming in from one donor in the state of Nevada.

- McCain: Mr. Adelson, who gave large amounts of money to the Gingrich campaign, and much of Mr. Adelson's casino profits that go to him come from his casino in Macau.

- Host: Which says what?

- McCain: Which says that obviously, maybe in a roundabout way, foreign money is coming into American political campaigns.

- Host: Because of the profits at the casinos?

- McCain: It's a great deal of money. And again, we need a level playing field. And we need to go back to the realization that Teddy Roosevelt had: that we have to have a limit on the flow of money and that corporations are not people. That's why we have different laws that govern corporations than govern individual citizens. And so to say that corporations are people, again, flies in the face of all the traditional Supreme Court decisions that we've made that have been made in the past.

> John McCain was a prominent American politician who served as a United States Senator from Arizona from 1987 until his death in 2018. He was also the Republican nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election, running against Barack Obama. Throughout his career, McCain was known for his military service, having been a naval aviator during the Vietnam War, where he endured years of imprisonment and torture as a prisoner of war. He was also recognized for his bipartisan approach to politics and his willingness to work across party lines on various issues.

There was bipartisan disapproval of a decision, particularly evident in the reaction of John McCain, a Republican who typically would have been expected to oppose President Obama on major decisions.
